	Hello and welcome!
</p>
<p>
	[=As a huge fan of Slack and Laravel, I decided to take the opportunity to create a Laravel Chat area with Slack. When I started I had trepiditions about doing this as there was already an IRC channel, and I didn't know if this would garner any interest.
</p>
<p>
	After seeing the member count jump from 20 to 200 in less than 48 hours, I was blown away. When the Laravel founder Tayler Otwell signed up, I was blown away again.=]
</p>
<p>
	I think we have something cool in the making here, and it is my hope that this chat and website offer some great support, opportunities and connections for those who join.
