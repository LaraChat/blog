    [=What makes the Laravel community so great is the people. In an ongoing series of blog posts we will be talking about some of the fantastic products the people are creating.

<p>
    This time we'll feature Joseph Cohen, CTO of Dinkbit.=]

   <h5>Tell us a bit about your development background and your favourite languages/tools.</h5>
   <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Hi I’m Joe. I’m 26 years old, born in Mexico City. I started developing at the age of 10 in C and made a piano. I fell in love with programming.</p>

            <p>When I was 13 years old, I stayed home sick for two weeks and was bored, so I found some tutorials online on how to make websites with Flash. One year later I wanted to help my father make his online store, so I started googling for “the best lang for e-commerce” and found ColdFusion. Everyone said that PHP was insecure and slow on forums. After a while I found that PHP was easy and great, not slow and insecure, if you know how to use it. Most of all it has a large and awesome community so I switched all my codebase to PHP. </p>

            <p>Like a lot of people I made my own framework until I found Zend and CodeIgniter. I started my own company - dinkbit - 4 years ago and currently work there. We had a lot of challenges so we started investigating languages and frameworks like Django, Rails and others but we kept going back to PHP. Then we started to do Apps so I’ve learned how to use Objective-C and Java with REST API’s done in Go. We were about to switch to Rails but one day I opened Tuts+ and saw Jeffrey Way talk about Laravel 3 and fell in love and never looked back. </p>

            <p>We still have an app running on L3 for a client. I’m also a designer so I like frontend from time to time with Backbone and Angular.</p>

            <p>A few moths ago I started to contribute to Open Source and I’m fascinated. I didn't understand the joy, rhythm, growth and passion of Open Source until I started to contribute. Currently I’m on the core team of Cachet.</p>

            <p>I find all of the languages have cool things, but the ones I use daily are PHP, Go and Javascript.</p>

            <p>The tools I use every day are:</p>

    <h5>What is the one tool that you cannot live without?</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>I’d say it’s iTerm with Oh My Zsh installed, it makes me work fast on the command line.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Tell us about NotifyMe</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>NotifyMe is a package for easy implementation of different notification service providers using a common API.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>What inspired you to develop NotifyMe?</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>We have being using Bugsnag for a while now and we love the multiple services and channels they offer to notify when a bug happens. We needed to implement that functionality on Cachet and also on a internal project, so I developed it and made it Open Source so anyone can implement a gateway (service) and support most of them.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>What was the hardest part of developing NotifyMe?</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>NotifyMe was developed based on another Package we use internally called PayMe - to handle multiple payment gateways for Mexico - so starting it was easy. I guess finding a common base for all the services and having to read through every gateway API documentation to implement it was, they all have their unique way of doing things.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>What can you tell us about the future of NotifyMe?</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The idea is to have most of the notification services on board, so we just moved the package repository to an organisation - thanks to Graham Campbell who is contributing - to split the gateways into separate projects for easy testing and maintenance. Each gateway can have dependencies and you can choose which ones to include on your project.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>What is the best Twitter account to follow and why is it <a href="http://twitter.com/larachatslack">@LaraChatSlack</a>?</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>This is a hard question because there is another account called @LaraChatSlack that are making a huge and excellent Laravel community to learn, discuss and have fun, and it is awesome :).</p>
