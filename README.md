# LaraChat Blog Files

> **Note:** The blog files in this repository are used in the [Statamic](http://statamic.com/) flat file CMS. 

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the LaraChat Blog! 

### Why is this crowd sourced?

We use the content that is provided to the LaraChat blog to promote and grow the Slack chat group. We also want to give the content providers the ability to use the blog to promote their apps, portfolio, jobs, and more. 

With the content, we will do our best to share it across the web to drive traffic and signups to chat. 

### How can I add my article?

We review all content coming in before placing on the site. If you wish to submit an article please submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/larachat/blog/pulls). Since the topic is about Laravel, please keep the articles focused to that topic. 

### Can I add my own links to the article?

Yes, we welcome you to drive traffic back to your website. We may restrict some URLs that come across too spammy or have malicious content. 


## Template

All files should be labeled in the following format: `yyyy-mm-dd-url-slug.md`. 

The top of your file must contain the following structure: 

```
---
title: Blog Post Title
categories:
  - Announcement
  - Foo
  - Bar
---
```

Below the above structure, you can provide your HTML markup of the blog posting.
