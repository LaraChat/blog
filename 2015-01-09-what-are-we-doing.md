<p>
    What are we doing here? larachat.co first and foremost is the plank to guide people to the larachat slack channel. (If you haven't signed up, <a href="/join">click here</a>)
</p>
<p>
    [=We have grand plans to keep this blog up to date with news, tips and resources about Laravel and other musings. We also plan to engage the community through contests, interviews and more! We've talked to a couple people who have written Laravel/PHP books to see if we can run a giveaway to our Slack members, so keep your eyes and ears open.=]
</p>
<p>
    In the interests of transparency... We will be putting ads on the website for a few reasons. First, to help offset technical costs (hosting, domain, etc), and second, to help finance any contests and giveaways we do. We believe in this community and the people here are awesome, so we want to help with perpetuating this awesomeness.

    Looking forward to Laravel 5 and a fantastic 2015!
